# Low-synchronisation-sensor-fusion-Lidar-Radar-and-Camera-using-if-else-logics
For the application of AV, sensor is often combined to produce a more robuts and better representation of the envrionment. Considering the excel of each sensor in different conditions, if/else logics is implemented to decide how each sensor will be weighted in different situations.

file SensorFusion.m is the main file to run the programme. The example of the results data is given in dataSample folder. The results is shown in figure below:

This algorithm takes into account 3 sensors weighting. Although, 2 sensors fusion is available, it is implemented for handling exception rather than improving the results. Thus, it might be worth trying fusing with 2 sensor results.
